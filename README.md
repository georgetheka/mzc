# MZ

A C library of basic data structures I wrote almost a decade ago when
I was working on some systems project and felt inspired to explore building a simple STL-ish like library.
I was cleaning up repos, and this one gave me a good laugh. I decided to put it on gh after
it had been collecting dust on bitbucket for years.


## Requirements

* make / gcc
* minunit testing library (included)

## Usage

To build and test run:

```bash
make clean && make && ./mzlib
```

The rest is self-explanatory (I hope).
